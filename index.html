<h1>I love you so much</h1>

<p>Hey Baby, Happy Birthday🥳🥳🥳🥳<br>
   <br>I am sorry that this isnt the best Present :( and its just something small, but I will promise that I will give you smth big next time<br>
   I still wish you a great Birthday and I hope you that will have fun today<br>
   YK time flies fast. I cant believe that youre already 14, it feels like we only met 2 months ago and thats crazy<br>
   Honestly the time we spent together, I really enjoyed it. I had so much fun together with you, even if there were some fighting we made up, wich makes me like you even more :D idk why but I like it<br>
   I just wish we could stay like this forever, it makes me happy, you make me happy baby and I hope its the same for you<br>
   I want to spend my future with you ml, I want to make you happy and give you what you want. I want to build a family with you, I want to do so many things but everything has to be done with you<br>
   tbh its kinda hard writing this bc there is just nothing in my head rn, all im thinking of is you nothing else. I just want to see, hold, kiss and care for you. Thats all I want<br>
   I am sorry again that its not the best give, ik I had enough time and that I didnt use it bc im dumb and was kinda feeling off... :) anyways<br>
   You know all I do is think of you, like what are you up to, or just some small things we would do together as a couple 😁<br>
   if you want I can buy you smth for Christmas, like these dolls you wanted. I can ship it to you then <br>

    <br>❤️ Stay strong my love, I love you and always will ❤️
